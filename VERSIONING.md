# Versioning

Tags are the version. `main` is where the code lives.

## Tags

Bare, numeric, semantic: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. **A published tag is never moved or deleted.** A mistake in a tagged release is fixed by a new release that says so.

Before `v1.0.0`, minors may break: `0.y.z` means pre-conformance. **`v1.0.0` is reserved for the first tag that runs the adopted KTP conformance suite green** and says so in its release notes. Green has a meaning here: the runner feeds each case's own inputs to the implementation, with no lookup tables or hardcoded results. Where a case hands the implementation a fact as a flag (a binding matched, a source authenticated, nothing was sent), the real check is its own entry in `claims.yaml`, with its evidence state, until it is built and shown.

## What a tag carries

A GitHub Release with notes stating which KTP release it implements, the conformance runner's output attached, and checksums beside any built artifact. Tags are signed by the maintainer.

## Pinning

Reference this project by tag. Reference KTP by tag; state it in the release notes and in `otcs.yaml` under `implements`. Between tags, `main` may carry material no tag contains; if you build against it, pin the exact commit and say so. A commit is a fixed point; `main` is not.

## Dependencies

`requirements.txt` with pinned versions. Dependabot proposes updates; the maintainer reviews them like any PR.
